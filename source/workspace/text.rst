========================
Installing a Text Editor
========================

Overview
========

Articles on SpongeDocs are saved as text files in the `reStructuredText <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_ markup language. Although your operating system's default text editor is likely sufficient for editing these files, installing a different text editor may prove to be useful.

Downloads
=========

Atom
~~~~

Atom is an open-source text editor published under the MIT license. Atom has built-in support for projects stored in a Git repository, such as SpongeDocs. `This article <http://blog.atom.io/2014/03/13/git-integration.html>`_ goes more in depth about the features of Atom's Git integration.

**Atom** can be downloaded for free from https://atom.io/.

Notepad++
~~~~~~~~~

Notepad++ is, arguably, one of the most popular text editors.

**Notepad++** can be downloaded for free from http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/.

Sublime Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sublime Text is another great text editor. It is cross platform, so it can be used on the three major operating systems. It also includes features such as macros, color customization, and it's own plugins.

**Sublime Text** can be downloaded for free from http://www.sublimetext.com/.
